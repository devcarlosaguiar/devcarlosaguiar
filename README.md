- Hi, Iâ€™m Carlos Aguiar
- Currently, I have been focusing my studies on web development, using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I am also actively engaged in BugBounty platforms where I seize the opportunity to enhance my knowledge in web security by identifying vulnerabilities and reporting them.
